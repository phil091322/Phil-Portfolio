            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p><strong>Challenge faced:</strong></p>

                <p><strong> Inventory Records</strong> – Discrepancies between recorded and actual stock levels lead to stockouts or overstocking, affecting business operations.</p>
                <p><strong> No System Available:</strong> The school does not have any monitoring system with our HRS course Inventory, we decide to initiate some survey with the one who manage the inventory and agreed, we took the initative to introduce the system and provide the solution offer and the scope of the system. The case study was approved so and we started developing the System</p>
                <p><strong> Concerns </strong> – Unauthorized access or data breaches can compromise sensitive inventory information.</p>
                <p><strong> Limitations </strong> – As School grow, the system may struggle to handle increased inventory volumes efficiently.</p>
                <p><strong> Mismanagement </strong> – Poor demand forecasting leads to either excess inventory or shortages, impacting profitability.</p>
                <p><strong>Reason for initiation:</strong></p>
                <p>The project was initiated due to inefficiencies in inventory management, leading to frequent stock discrepancies and operational delays.</p>
                <p>School faced challenges in tracking stock levels accurately, resulting in overstocking or shortages that affected profitability.</p>
                <p>Manual inventory processes were prone to human errors, requiring a system that could automate stock updates and improve accuracy.</p>
                <p>There was a need for a centralized platform to streamline inventory tracking, optimize resource allocation, and enhance decision-making.</p>
                <p>Security concerns regarding unauthorized access to inventory data prompted the development of a system with robust access controls.</p>
                <p>Scalability issues in existing inventory solutions made it difficult for businesses to expand operations efficiently.</p>
                <p>To address these challenges, the project was initiated to develop an inventory system that integrates automation, security, and real-time tracking.</p>
